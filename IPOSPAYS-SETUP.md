# iPOSpays Pay Links — Setup Guide

FarriTech can take pay-link payments through a farrier's own iPOSpays (Dejavoo) merchant
account instead of Stripe, using the iPOSpays **Hosted Payment Page** (HPP).

## What changes when a farrier connects iPOSpays

- The pay link customers get (`https://app.farritech.com/pay/{invoiceId}`) opens an iPOSpays
  payment page instead of Stripe Checkout. Links already sent keep working.
- The amount is FarriTech's own price (card price unless waived). iPOSpays is told not to add
  fees, tax or tips (`calculateFee`, `calculateTax`, `tipsInputPrompt` all false).
- Invoices are marked paid automatically, and the customer gets the usual "payment received" text.
- Recording a cash/check/Zelle/etc. payment, or waiving the card price, cancels the open
  iPOSpays page so the customer can't pay twice.
- **Refunds:** the Refund button on an invoice paid through iPOSpays (manager password required)
  voids it if the batch hasn't settled, otherwise refunds it, via iPOS Transact
  (`POST payment.ipospays.{tech,com}/api/v3/iposTransact`, transactionType 2 or 3, by the
  payment's RRN). Partial amounts are always refunds. Refunds done in the iPOSpays portal
  aren't seen by FarriTech.
- **Keyed cards:** Pay Now on desktop (Invoices) and Card on mobile show an iPOSpays payment page in a
  frame inside FarriTech for the amount chosen (card price unless waived), with a link to open it in a
  new tab if the frame doesn't load. The farrier types the card there and presses Pay Now; the app checks
  with iPOSpays every few seconds and shows the payment once it's approved. (iPOSpays' page sends no
  X-Frame-Options or frame-ancestors, so it can be framed — checked 2026-10-13.) The card number goes straight to iPOSpays, never through
  FarriTech. The payment is recorded as `card_keyed` / `paidVia: ipospays_keyed`. Opening the form closes
  the customer's open pay-link page (a new one is made when they next open the link).
- **Still Stripe only:** the customer portal.

Disconnecting iPOSpays sends pay links back to Stripe.

## What the farrier needs (iPOSpays portal, Merchant Admin login)

| Field in FarriTech | Where to find it |
|---|---|
| Environment | Sandbox for testing, Production for real payments |
| TPN | The 12-digit CloudPOS TPN of the merchant account |
| API Key / Secret Key | Settings → Generate API & Secret Key |
| Ecom Token | Settings → Merchant Keys / Ecom Token → pick the TPN → Generate Token |

Enter them in **Settings → iPOSpays Payments** (desktop or mobile) and click **Validate & Save**.
FarriTech checks the keys with iPOSpays before saving, then stores everything in the locked
`farrierSecrets/{uid}` document. Keys are never sent back to the browser.

## How it works

| Step | iPOSpays API |
|---|---|
| Get an auth token (24 h, cached, refreshed automatically) | `POST auth.ipospays.{tech,com}/v1/authenticate-token` (headers `apiKey`, `secretKey`, `TokenExpiryMinutes` only) |
| Make the payment page | `POST payment.ipospays.{tech,com}/api/v3/external-payment-transaction` |
| Confirm a payment | `GET api.ipospays.{tech,com}/v1/queryPaymentStatus` (Ecom token) |
| Close a page | `POST payment.ipospays.{tech,com}/api/v1/cancel` |

Keyed cards use the same payment page (`stripe-payment` actions `ipospays_keyed` to make it,
`ipospays_check` to run Query Payment Status for it).

iPOSpays reports payments to `/api/ipospays/callback/{invoiceId}` (server to server) and sends
the customer back to `/pay/{invoiceId}?ipos_ref=…`. Neither is trusted on its own: each one
just triggers Query Payment Status, and only an approved status is recorded. Code:
`api/_lib/ipospays.js`. It runs inside `api/stripe-payment.js`, because Vercel Hobby allows
only 12 functions.

`.tech` hosts = sandbox, `.com` hosts = production, chosen per farrier by the Environment setting.

## What the first sandbox test showed (2026-10-08)

A $1.03 test payment on sandbox TPN 950126444275 went through end to end and marked the invoice
paid. iPOSpays behaves differently from its docs in a few ways, and the code handles each:

1. **Token request.** Only `apiKey`, `secretKey` and `TokenExpiryMinutes` headers, with no `scope`
   (confirmed by Dejavoo support). With a scope, payment pages fail with "User is not registered
   for PaymentTokenization".
2. **Query Payment Status answer.** It's `{ status, data: { responseCode, transactionReferenceId,
   totalAmount, ... } }` (`{ status: "Pending", data: {} }` until it settles), not
   `{ iposHPResponse }`. Amounts are in cents (`"103"` = $1.03).
3. **Return URL.** iPOSpays appends its own `?responseCode=…` to our return URL, so only the
   leading reference id of `ipos_ref` is used.
4. **One try per page.** A page expires after one attempt, declined or not, so a retry gets a
   new page. Opening `/pay/{invoiceId}` checks the recent pages with iPOSpays before offering one.
5. **Callback.** It arrives before the payment settles (status Pending), so the customer's
   return to `/pay/{invoiceId}` is what usually records the payment.

On a Vercel preview, pay links point at the preview's branch URL so the whole flow can be
tested there.

iPOSpays docs require.
